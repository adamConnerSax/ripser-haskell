## ripser-haskell (v 0.1.0.0)

# Introduction
A wrapper around [ripser](https://github.com/Ripser/ripser) which formats a distance matrix or point-cloud to send to ripser
on stdin and then parses the returned persistence intervals.

From the repo: "Ripser is a lean C++ code for the computation of Vietorisâ€“Rips persistence barcodes. 
It can do just this one thing, but does it extremely well."

Perhaps this will evolve to wrap the ripser code itself as a library we can call with the FFI.  But for now, this will do.

# Installation
This package requires that "ripser" is on your path or that the path is given in the configuration.

Building ripser should be as easy as:

```
git clone https://github.com/Ripser/ripser
cd ripser
make
```

and then you can install it, e.g.,
```cp ripser /usr/local/bin```
